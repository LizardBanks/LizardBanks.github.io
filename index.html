	<p> I feel like I offer you an explanation. You kept asking ‘Why?’, so I’ll just put down what I think I remember of my thoughts during. Hopefully it can offer closure or at least provide some clarity. </p>
	<p> I won’t start quite at the beginning, but I will say, I probably had a crush on you at the start. At the time I would say I probably had a crush on any girl that gave me the time of day and spoke to me. As we got to know each other more, I began to treasure your friendship and I lost that initial physical attraction. I don’t think I had any thoughts like that when I kissed you that time, if I’m remembering correctly, you had kissed Jono and Vince in some event in your room. Maybe I was jealous, I don’t know. I was pretty damn drunk, so overflowing with confidence and lack of thought and that lead to that. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed your company, those final days to the end of the year were a blast. Then I went home and mostly forgot about it and began enjoying my time there. By the time we went on holiday, I associated myself with home and had grown out of any feelings I had previously. </p>
	<p> At the beginning of 2nd year, you confessed your feelings again, I was flattered but I really didn’t see you in any romantic light by then. It didn’t elicit anything from me, bar happiness for the validation of myself that it provided. I thought my actions spoke loud enough and you got the message. I didn’t want to outright turn you down in case I squandered our friendship.  </p>
	<p> Throughout the year, we continued spending time together, I obviously knew you liked me, so I tried not to give mixed messages and treated you the same way I’d treat any of my other friends. At times, this was quite tough and I’m afraid at points my base emotions overstepped their mark. It was strange though, I knew I didn’t love you or want to date you, but I began viewing it as an option. Like weighing up between what you want for dinner. The mere fact that I had the capacity to do that told me that I shouldn’t get involved with you in that way. Yet, I would still feel jealousy if I saw you talking to other people. This confused me further. Often you would stay in my room, and eventually got quite brazen. You would kiss me and try to cuddle me, I tried to showcase my indifference by not responding to any of this. It made me feel quite uncomfortable. I didn’t want to send you home, “why should I? She’s my friend after all.” I would tell myself but at points like these, I would feel minor irritation. I liked your company as it helped stave away loneliness but at points, I would find you annoying more than anything else especially when I was tired. Some nights, I would tell you to go home and you simply would refuse to, so there was nothing I could do short of throwing you out, which I don’t feel comfortable doing.  </p>
	<p> Eventually, towards the end of the year, I started thinking about polyamorous relationships. I had spent the year mulling over relationships and how I didn’t want one. Then, something came along that seemed to fit what I wanted. I’m realising now, that I don’t think I’m cut out for polyamorous relationships either. I’m still not ready for an intimate relationship. We went to get coffee and discussed it quite a bit. You agreed with me about them, which I remember thinking was probably not true. The take I took from it, was less of a legitimate polyamorous relationship and more of an excuse to do whatever I like, with anyone I like, without any repercussions. Which I admit was incredibly naïve and not thought out.  Alas, with that fresh in my mind, and with me feeling particularly lonely and having spent the entire day with you. We got drunk, you stayed in my room again even with my reluctance. You began to do your usual of trying to elicit some reaction from me. And I thought, well if she is aware that I don’t want a girlfriend and still goes this far, then what the heck. I let my desire take over, but I felt dirty. It was obvious to me, that you had reached a point where you liked me so much, that it no longer mattered to you what I was thinking, you just wanted to be close to me. I felt like I was using you. I’m not sure what narrative you had running in your head from this point. This is really when my most pathetic side revealed itself to me. I knew that I didn’t want to continue yet felt too small to say stop. A bit of me obviously longed for a connection like this with someone and I hadn’t the balls to pull the brakes.  </p>
	<p> That night, I legitimately came over to go to sleep. Just read some C&P and take some Z’s. Obviously, I find kissing and heavy petting a lot of fun, which is another reason why I didn’t want to stop. We got to it, and eventually desire took over me. But once the night took that direction, I couldn’t help but feel like I was making a terrible mistake. That this was not remotely fair on you. I thought it was something you wanted, but at this point I didn’t. I tried to stop it, but it was too late, and I think you just thought I was being awkward and quirky. I didn’t know how to stop it without hurting your feelings. The dam had burst, life was going on all around me and I felt powerless, even though I was the one who should have been at the wheel. I just sat and took it. I regressed into a tiny corner of my mind just waiting for it to end. </p>
	<p> After going back home, my relationship with this other person became much more intimate almost instantly. I had been speaking with her intermittently throughout the year, but it took off then. I didn’t know how to tell you. Well, more like I didn’t want to tell you. The conversation seemed like the most daunting thing, so instead I ignored you. I spoke with more venom, I tried becoming as cold as I could on you to give you the message without words. This was clearly not the way I should have handled it, but it was the one I went for. I filled your life with pain for the past 6-7 months and for that I really do apologise. I know you have some sort of deified image of me in your head, so I hope this can defile that in the way only truth can.  I’d like to <b>thankyou for being there through difficult times for me </b>and offering your support every step of the way. Like yesterday, you spoke a stream of your thoughts. Here are mine. Unedited and raw. I’m not sure if sending them will be healthy but here you go. </p>
	<p> I think we were living in two separate realities. You were living in one, where I reciprocated your feelings and I was just a social introvert, so my idiosyncrasies could be laughed off and thought of as ‘innocent’. Whereas I was living, where we were just doing it because it’s a need that humans have. An innate craving deep within all for companionship. Harsh and impersonal, but what I thought I wanted. I used and abused your sentimentality and feelings and for that <b>I am deeply sorry. </b>   </p>
